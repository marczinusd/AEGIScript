AEGIScript
==========

AEGIScript is a dynamically typed script language created using ANTLR v3.5's C# target. It'a main purpose is to provide an easy to use language for the developers of the AEGIS project to write geoinformatics batch-scripts in. 

The application comes with a user interface designed in Windows Presentation Foundation, with AvalonEdit as the editor, and MahApps for window and controller styling.
